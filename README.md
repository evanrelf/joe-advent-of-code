# AdventOfCode

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an
[Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) comprised of
small programming puzzles that are designed to be solved in any language. This
repo represents my journey to better learn how to program. I started with
solutions in Python, later transitioning to TypeScript using
[Deno](https://deno.land/).

I come back to these problems when I have free time. This is very much a work in
progress.
